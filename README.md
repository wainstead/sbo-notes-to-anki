# sbo-notes-to-anki Safari Books Online to Anki

Safari Books Online lets you highlight book passages and attach notes to those passages.

It also lets you download all of your highlights and notes as a CSV file.

This script will parse the CSV file from Safari Books Online and output 
a CSV file you can import into Anki. Each line of the file will be a new card.

For an example on importing to Anki see 
[this post on StackExchange](https://superuser.com/questions/698902/can-i-create-an-anki-deck-from-a-csv-file).
